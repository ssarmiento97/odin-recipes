# odin-recipes

This is the start of my first project for TheOdinProject.

I am looking to practice and demonstrate a foundational
knowledge of HTML by building the skeleton of a recipe
website.

I will be using tags to properly section and identify the
content on the website, as well as including links to 
other pages and images.
